Building
-----------------------------------------------------

Inside 'sudoku' directory:
cmake .
make

-----------------------------------------------------
Running
-----------------------------------------------------

From the 'sudoku' directory:
./build/bin/sudoku <filepath>

Example
./build/bin/sudoku files/file.txt

Displays the initial board followed by the solution and computation time.

File format
-----------------------------------------------------

The file format is currently pretty cryptic, but straightforward.  Each file
includes each 3x3 patch, from left to right, top to bottom (i.e. reading 
order) as shown below.

Patch order:
[1] [2] [3]
[4] [5] [6]
[7] [8] [9]

Each patch is a set of 9 numbers such as:
3 -1 -1
-1 9 6
-1 -1 7

Values of -1 represent blank squares while all other numbers are the values
located in those squares.  If you search and replace all -1 values with a '*'
character, the format becomes easier to read (although the 'sudoku' program
won't be able to read it)
3 * *
* 9 6
* * 7

If the format is confusing, compare the values in the file to the pretty print
version of the board printed by the 'sudoku' program.
